e.nable Program Brief

e.nable is the digitally powered business transformation program aimed at changing and improving the way we work in Yara, including replacement of the Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) landscape, which covers the vast majority of our value processes and all revenue streams and is no longer fit for current purpose or our future ambitions. This will be achieved through the creation of a light and flexible operational backbone, allowing Yara to adapt existing and/or introduce new operating and business models at speed.

The operational backbone will provide master data and the transaction processing workflow for Yara’s core processes. The execution of the operational backbone is to be achieved through projects, each with its own business case and governance. The e.nable Program steers and monitors interdependent projects of two types: Framework projects and Realization projects. Learn more about our projects here.

All projects in the e.nable portfolio, whether Framework or Realization, are funded in a central frame subject to Yara’s Capital Value Process (CVP) and Project Portfolio Management (YPPM). For 2024, the e.nable Program is included in Yara's key strategic priority to scale-up the digital transformation of the organization.
